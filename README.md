# Python-Final-Project
My Final Project known as "Dead Hands" for python, a buckshot roulette inspired card game.
The project utilizes async, enumeration and multithreading to have the ability to be ran even on devices with ram in the megabytes
My biggest challenge was learning the indiviudal libraries and understanding how to piece them together 

This application only uses 20MB of Ram, It is error proof and is purposely built to be infuriatingly hard. It was made in under 200 lines and I have spent about 40 hours coding it for optimization and ease of use. I've spent a total of 4 hours play-testing it. 

To my professor I most definitely ask you to please take a try with this game and let me know if you can beat it without the cheats.
